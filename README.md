A web portal to save your google drive links in firebase and produce dashboard using google analytics in firebase console
On the "Maintain Courses" tab, we take in the google drive links, the idea is to shorten these urls using Dynamic links using Firebase and store them in the Firebase.
A dashboard is created by Google analytics on how many members have accessed the link.
